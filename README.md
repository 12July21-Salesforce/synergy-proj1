# Synergy Home Builders

## Project Description

Our project expanded upon Ethan's homebuilding company from project 0. We replicated the core custom objects into a fresh Trailhead Playground and made modifications to fields as necessary and added custom Visualforce pages and components for additional functionality. David and Jorge added GUIs to aid with the creation of Realtors, Customers, and Contracts. Will, Murrai, and Joey made pages that made it easier to view different arrangements of lots based on if they were sold, who they were sold by, and if they were fully developed. Ethan made a page that allows searching for buyers who have made purchases in a given time period. We created an Experience site to be used by Realtor partners so they could access relevant data from our org.
